## 📋 Manual Testing Checklist

### Pre-Testing Setup
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Ensure Vertex AI credentials are configured
3. Have test accounts ready (free and paid tier)
4. Clear browser storage for clean tests

### Authentication Tests
- [ ] Unauthenticated users cannot access /app/chat
- [ ] Login redirects work properly
- [ ] Valid sessions allow chat access
- [ ] Session expiration handled gracefully

### Free User Flow (0 → 30 messages)
- [ ] Start with fresh free user account
- [ ] Send first message - should work
- [ ] Quota display shows "29/30 remaining"
- [ ] Continue until 30 messages sent
- [ ] 31st message should be blocked with clear error
- [ ] Upgrade prompt displayed
- [ ] UI input disabled after limit

### Paid User Flow (Daily Reset)
- [ ] Start with paid user account
- [ ] Send messages up to daily limit (30)
- [ ] Verify quota display shows "0/30 remaining"
- [ ] Wait for reset time or simulate day passage
- [ ] Verify quota resets to "30/30 remaining"
- [ ] Can send messages again

### Streaming Response Tests
- [ ] Messages appear character by character
- [ ] No lag or stuttering in streaming
- [ ] "Leo is typing..." indicator shows
- [ ] Stream completes properly
- [ ] Error during stream handled gracefully

### Context and Relevance Tests
- [ ] AI responses mention user's current level
- [ ] Responses relevant to business learning
- [ ] Context includes user progress
- [ ] Free vs paid tier recognized
- [ ] Current step (text/video/test) context

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] Network disconnection during stream
- [ ] Invalid message format
- [ ] Server error (500) handling
- [ ] Rate limit exceeded (429) handling
- [ ] Authentication lost during chat

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Initial chat load < 2 seconds
- [ ] Message send response < 2 seconds
- [ ] Streaming starts < 1 second
- [ ] Quota updates < 500ms
- [ ] No memory leaks after long usage

### UI/UX Tests
- [ ] Chat interface mobile responsive
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts work (Enter to send)
- [ ] Shift+Enter creates new line
- [ ] Message history scrolls properly
- [ ] Timestamps display correctly
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Loading states provide feedback

## 🔧 Debugging Tools

### Development Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose AI logging
AI_DEBUG=true npm run dev

# Check context caching
# Look for "Context cache hit/miss" in console

# Monitor database queries
# Check Supabase dashboard for query performance
```

### Browser Dev Tools
```javascript
// Test streaming in console
fetch('/api/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Test' })
}).then(response => response.body.getReader())

// Check quota state
// Look for useAIQuota hook state in React DevTools
```

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check user quota
SELECT ai_messages_count, ai_daily_reset_at, tier_type 
FROM user_profiles 
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';

-- Check message counter updates
SELECT * FROM user_profiles 
WHERE updated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```
